Cost of Material Handling Calculator
------------------------------------

Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the phisical layout and the handling equipment are set, it's possible to measure the distances between clusters and the times of every travel, comprehensive of the 
times for the loading and unloading of the vehicles. It is also possible to decide how much space to allocate to the storage of pallets in the plant.
With the information about the total distances or times travelled in a day, and with knowledge of the specific costs of travelling in €/meter or €/minute, it is possible 
to calculate the cost of material handling.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* From-to chart: see from-to chart documentation

* Disposable storage area for every machine

* Informations about the vehicles: speed, acceleration, deceleration, up-times, load/unload times, pallets capacity, costs in €/m or €/minute

* Area of a single pallets

* Vehicles disposable working time in a day

Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Total material handling costs (for all the products and all the travels per day)

* Matrix of the costs of single travels between machines

* Number of vehicles

* Times and distances travelled for every product or every vehicle

* Key Performance Indicators about areas and material flows
