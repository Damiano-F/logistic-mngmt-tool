Creation of the Part-Machine Incidence Matrix (PMIM)
------------------------------------------------------

Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To understand the flow of materials in a manufacturing plant, it is first of all necessary to know, for every product, the production cycle, which is the oredered list of 
machinings that the product undergoes from the moment it enters the plant up until the exit. The production cycle depends from the phisical properties of an object, and 
it's not possible to change it in the short or medium term, because it would require a leap in the technology of the processing machines involved. This implies that once 
the production cycle is set, the type of machines needed is also set.

Considering all the machines of the same kind grouped in the same workshop, the part-machine incidence matrix associates, for every product, the workshops it has to 
visit to complete its processing. The PMIM shows the list of workshops in the rows, and the list of products in the columns, and the values of the cells can be 1 if the 
product visits the corresponding workshop, 0 otherwise.
The result is a matrix that shows, for every workshop, if it is involved or not in the flow of materials of a certain product.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bill of Materials: for every finished product, it listst the quantity and quality of raw materials and parts required to produce it, so it defines the flow generated
    by one single product inside the plant (but we are not interested in the quantity information to build the PMIM)

* Production cycles: for every product or part, the sequence of workshops visited and informations about the machining process, like the processing times

Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Part-Machine incidence matrix
