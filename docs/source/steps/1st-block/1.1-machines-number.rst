Number of machines Calculator
------------------------------------

Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage the flow of a certain quantity of materials trough the plant, there needs to be enough processing power available. It is possible to calculate the number of 
machines needed in every workshop as a ratio between the total processing time for a day of production and the working time available to a single machine in a day.
For example, with 9600 minutes of processing/day and 960 minutes of work/day, the workshop will need exactly 10 machines. 

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Production cycles: for every product or part, the sequence of workshops visited and informations about the machining process, like the processing times

* Daily demand of parts/products for the process considered 

* Bill of Materials: for every finished product, it listst the quantity and quality of raw materials and parts required to produce it, so it defines the flow generated
by one single product inside the plant

* Parts-machines incidence matrix: see PMIM documentation

* Available working time in a day for every workshop, considering also pauses and machine downtimes, usually in minutes/day

Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Number of machines per workshop, rounded to the first upper integer

* Total machining time over one day
