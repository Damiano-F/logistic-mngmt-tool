PMIM Formation

Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To understand the flow of materials in a manufacturing plant, it is first of 
all necessary to know, for every product, the production cycle, and the 
Bill of Materials.
The production cycle depends from the phisical properties of an object.
It's not possible to change it in the short or medium term, because it would 
require a leap in the technology of the processing machines involved.
This implies that once the production cycle is set, the type of machines needed 
is also set. 
Together with the Bill of Materials, it defines the flow generated by one 
single product inside the plant.


Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Bill of Materials:     A set of raw materials and parts required to produce a 
                        finished product. 

                        Every entry reports both the type and the quantity of 
                        the materials required.

:Production cycles:     A list of sequences of machinings.

                        Every sequence is the array of machinings required to 
                        complete a part or product. 

Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:PMIM:  A *n*x*m* matrix where *n* is the number of unique types of workshops 
        and *m* is the number of different parts. 

        Each element of the matrix may contain:

        - 1 if the product visits the corresponding workshop
        - 0 otherwise.
