From-to matrix Formation
------------------------------------

Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the clusters and the production cycles set, the flows of materials between and inside clusters are qualitatively set, so we can create a square matrix with clusters 
as rows and column headers, which shows for each element of the matrix if a flow of materials is present between a cluster and another.
By knowing the daily product demand, the bill of materials and the capacity of vehicles we can determine not only the qualitative from-to matix but also the quantitative 
from-to, which shows for every element the number of travels between clusters.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Clusters

* Production cycles

* Daily product demand

* Bill of Materials

* Vehicles capacity (pieces transported in one travel)

Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* From-to Matrix
