Takt Time 
----------------------

Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Takt Time is the rate of production of a productive process and can be calculated for machines, workshops, assembly lines or entire plants. It is defined as a ratio 
between the working time of the process in a working day and the daily demand of a product/part or family of products/parts.
For example, if the working time of a machine is 960 minutes/day, and the product demand is 1000 pieces/day, the tackt time is 0.96 minutes/piece.

Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bill of Materials: for every finished product, it listst the quantity and quality of raw materials and parts required to produce it, so it defines the flow generated by one single product inside the plant

* Daily demand of parts/products for the process considered 

* Working time in a day for every workshop, considering also pauses and machine downtimes, usually in minutes/day

* Parts-machines incidence matrix: see PMIM documentation

* Production cycles: for every product or part, the sequence of workshops visited and informations about the machining process, like the processing times. The production cycles are necessary to calculate the takt time to check if a machining process is repeated more than one time inside the cycle

Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Takt Time for every process in the plant, both considering the total of the daily production and separately for each product/part
