A set of identical machines sharing the same location in the plant layout.

Properties:

-   Name [local, constant]
-   ID [local, constant]
-   Type of machines [local, constant]
-   Number of machines (init. at 0) [local, variable]
-   Number of operators (init. at 0) [local, variable]
-   Shifts [local, constant]
-   Machine cost [local, constant]
-   Storage area [local, constant]
-   Coordinates inside the layout ??? [local, constant]

Use Cases:

-   Evaluation of Machines Duplication Options
-   Cost of Material Handling 
-   Machines Estimate
-   Sequencing
-   Takt Time 

The requirements are:

-   The number of machines must be changeable
-   The coordinates must be changeable
